FieldVal UI has its own minimal css theme located in [themes/minimal.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FieldVal/fieldval-ui/master/themes/minimal.css). All code examples include this theme for demonstration purposes. However, the theme is completely optional and is never included into your code by default. 

[minimal.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FieldVal/fieldval-ui/master/themes/minimal.css) should serve as a good template for creating custom themes.
