The library implements many basic fields that are very common in applications of any type. However, when basic fields do not satisfy requirements of the application, it is easy to create [fully customized fields](/docs/fieldvalui/Customizing/Fields).

All fields have ```.val()``` method equivalent to the one in the form. The method returns parsed output, which is different for each field.
